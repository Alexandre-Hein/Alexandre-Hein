<h1> Hey there 👋 Welcome to my GitHub ! </h1> 

<p>I'm a student at Epitech Strasbourg with a background in English (weird combo, but it works!). Currently adventuring the IT world, I'm now turning to the Cybersecurity and AdminSys realm and experimenting (in complete legality). When I'm not playing with VMs or getting <strong>404 Not Found</strong>, I'll be delving into algorithms or learning Cybersecurity. 🔐</p>

## What I do ##

<ul>
  <li>🔒 Cybersecurity enthusiast: Trying to explore this world and hopefully never end up in jail.</li>
  <li>🧙‍♂️ Networking wizard: For some reasons, my VMs start breaking when I touch them.</li>
  <li>🧼 Code cleaner: Cleaning up code is my thing.</li>
</ul>
